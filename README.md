  ### About AI
  
  It is applied minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. 
  The depth of algorithm is 1, 3 and 5. This application allow the user adjust the difficult of AI.
  In the game user interface, we can see easy, middle, hard options that represents the different AI (the depth of minmax algorithm)
  
  ### About Algorithm(minimax alpha-beat pruning)
  A minimax algorithm is a recursive algorithm for choosing the next move in an n-player game, usually a two-player game. 
  Alpha\'96beta pruning is a search algorithm that seeks to decrease the number of nodes that are evaluated by the minimax algorithm in its search tree.\
  For example:
